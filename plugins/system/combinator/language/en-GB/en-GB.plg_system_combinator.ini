Example: <code>media/com_example/js/example.js</code></p><p>Only files added through Joomla's Document object can be replaced in the output. Dynamic files, e.g. those that go through Joomla's <code>index.php</code> CAN NOT be combined. Minified (.min.js) and non-minified (.js) files are different; listing one does not cause the other to be combined. Order matters; files are combined in the order encountered. If you use custom output files they will be generated and loaded in the order encountered on this list. Using a third party JS/CSS compression extension or a similar template feature is incompatible with this plugin.</p><p><strong>WARNING!</strong> Combining JS/CSS files may cause display issues and/or JavaScript errors. Add files carefully and progressively. Some files cannot be combined. Always err on the side of caution. This software's license explicitly states there is no warranty and has a liability waiver; if you mess up your site using this plugin you get the blame. If you do not agree with these terms you are not allowed to use the software. Be careful and methodical. Haste is the enemy of quality.</p>"
